# AudioPluginHost Mark II

This was started as a fork of Juce AudioPluginHost, but looks like this is going to be a completely
new application instead, because of the massive changes needed all around for everything
to support Clap plugins. 

This is currently completely non-functional for end users. Hopefully some sort of
working alpha/beta version will be ready before 2025.
